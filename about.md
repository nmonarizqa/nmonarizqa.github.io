Hello, my name is Nurvirta Monarizqa, but simply call me Mona. 

I am an Urban Data Scientist based in New York, currently pursuing Master Degree at Center for Urban Science + Progress, New York University.

I love playing with data and visualization, especially when it comes to data for greater good. Besides data analyzing, sometimes I do web design and some digital illustration. You can see my portofolio [here](https://nmonarizqa.github.com), my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmonarizqa), or my other writings on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nmonarizqa).

Let's keep in touch! Drop me a message at nmonarizqa [at] windowslive [dot] com. See you there :)
